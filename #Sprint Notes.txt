#Sprint Notes:

Setup:
  Look over server.js to get a feel for Express 4.
  run:
    npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli nodemon
    npm install
    bower install
    mongod (in it's own terminal tab)
    gulp
    gulp karma (to run tests)


Requirements:
  Build out LinksController and template.

  Build out ShortenController and template.

  Build out Links service.
  
  Add routing for both Links and Shorten templates.
  
  Pass tests for the above.
  
  Enable navigation between the links view and the shorten view.
  Default to links view if unknown route is attempted.
  
  Validate the shorten links form before it submits to server.
  Validate the sign up/sign in form before it submits to server.
  Show errors when forms are invalid.

  Display the links on the listing page sorted by visit count.
  Add a live-search box that displays only the links that match the search criteria.



Tips:
  The point of a controller is to expose data to our view via $scope, and add functions to that $scope to define view behaviors.

  When you use a controller to manipulate the DOM, you write directives.

  Angular's router injects a template to ng-view when a new route is hit, and loads a new controller if you want.
