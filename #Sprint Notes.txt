#Sprint Notes:

Setup:
  Look over server.js to get a feel for Express 4.
  run:
    npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli nodemon
    npm install
    bower install
    mongod (in it's own terminal tab)
    gulp
    gulp karma (to run tests)


Requirements:
  
  
  Enable navigation between the links view and the shorten view.
  
  Validate the shorten links form before it submits to server.

  Validate the sign up/sign in form before it submits to server.
  
  Show errors when forms are invalid.

  Display the links on the listing page sorted by visit count.

  Add a live-search box that displays only the links that match the search criteria.
    use 'show' + filter


Tips:
  The point of a controller is to expose data to our view via $scope, and add functions to that $scope to define view behaviors.

  When you use a controller to manipulate the DOM, you write directives.

  Angular's router injects a template to ng-view when a new route is hit, and loads a new controller if you want.
